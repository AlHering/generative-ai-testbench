# Generative AI Testbench
Testbench for projects based on Generative AI Frameworks like Langchain (https://docs.langchain.com/docs/) or MS Guidance (https://github.com/microsoft/guidance/tree/main/docs).

# Setup
The basic setup would be to install conda, create a conda environment with Python 3.10 and install the requirements from requirements.txt.
Since the requirements are geared towards linux on a x86_64 the installation will fail on other OSes/architectures. You can either adjust the requirements or build and run the project inside a Docker container via the given Dockerfile.
